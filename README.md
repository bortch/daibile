## In short

How does a blockchain work?

There is a lot of literature on the subject.

Everyone is talking about it, but beyond the background noise in which everyone says what they understand about blockchain or bitcoin, I was left with many questions:

- What is a wallet?
- What are keys and address?
- How does a transaction work?

- How do you ensure that you actually own the tokens being traded?
- How is the information transmitted to the network?
- How do nodes validate transactions?
- How are transaction fees charged?

To make sure I understood how it worked, there was only one thing to do: do it.

- What an address is.
- What a transaction consists of.
- How a transaction between 2 addresses is carried out.
- How the initiator of the transaction proves that he owns the funds he transfers.
- How a node ensures that the transaction is valid.
