# Daibile

## WTF

"Daibile" is the acronym for **D**umb **a**nd **I**nsecure **B**lockchain **I**mplementation **L**earning **E**xercice 

It has to be pronounced in the French way `[debil]` which means **moron**.

## In short

Again, learn by doing.

How does a blockchain work?

There is a lot of literature on the subject.

My goal is simply to be able to naively imagine how a blockchain works.

It's also an opportunity to practice Python :blush:
